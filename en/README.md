# Mastering QTUM - Developer's Guide to QTUM

Qtum is a decentralized layer 1 blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, but with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer.

* Qtum has compatibility with the Ethereum JSON-RPC api as well via [Janus](https://github.com/qtumproject/janus)

* Qtum supports Java development via [Qtumj](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumj) which is a fork of Bitcoinj, Qtumj is a fullnode but doesn't have any APIs for querying EVM state - only creating transactions.
